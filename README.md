This is a visual basic program

I was developed this program with Visual Basic on the VB6 IDE.

I put the visual basic project files in the "vb6 project" directory.
Meanwhile, I use the "project summary" directory to put the source code files and an overview of the application when it is run.

Because Visual Basic is not one of the most popular, so that we can quickly understand it, I have included the source code files in the form of txt files and screenshots of the application description while running.

The data of prospective students who register themselves are stored in a database file with the name "data calon peserta didik.mdb" in the "vb6 project" directory.

I like to make application programs and ready to learn and work hard as a programmer using the "most popular" category programming language.

I really hope to be given the opportunity to work in your company with the required programming language.
